# Diary

## Introduction

Welcome to Diary based on React! This repository hosts the Diary web page.

### About Diary

Diary is React based project, which is beginner-friendly. I wanted to start small and I think with small steps, I am progressing into a complete product.

### Why Diary project?

- There aren't many diary web pages around. I personally use Google Forms to write about my days, but I figured, I wanted to create my own website for this. And I think I can develop this further, gather feedback, and possibly develop it with a larger audience in mind.
