## How to run

Open the client folder in the terminal and run with npm start. Additionally, open the server folder in the terminal and write node server.js and you are good to go. Note that the .env file is missing, you have to define your own MongoDB URI and REACT_Backend_URL and REACT_SOCKET_URL for the front end.

## Introduction

Welcome to Diary based on MERN! This repository hosts the Diary web page / app.

### About Diary

The diary is a MERN-based project, that is beginner-friendly. I wanted to start small and I think with small steps, I am progressing into a complete product.

### Why Diary project?

- There aren't many diary web pages around. I personally use Google Forms to write about my days, but I figured, I wanted to create my own website for this. And I think I can develop this further, gather feedback, and possibly develop it with a larger audience in mind.
