### About Diary

[Project Name] is [briefly describe the purpose or goal of the project]. It [mention any key features or functionalities].

### Why Diary project?

- There aren't many diary web pages around. I personally use Google Forms to write about my days, but I figured, I wanted to create my own website for this. And I think I can develop this further, gather feedback, and possibly develop it with a larger audience in mind.
